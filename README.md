# js-calculator
Basic JavaScript calculator project
At leaset is was meant to becasic in the beginnning.
In general it works as a classic calculator. 
I decided to add the calcuation beginning with the negative number.

The functionality of the calculator is based on classes and constructors - makes the code look much neater.
This was based on an online tutorial by WebDevSimplified.
